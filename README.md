# Reason12-AKAI-Midmix-integration
Repository containing necessary files for Reason 12 and AKAI Midimix controller integration. Copy files MIDImix.lua, MIDImix.luacodec, MIDImix.png to C:\Program Files\Propellerhead\Reason 12\Remote\DefaultCodecs. Copy file MIDImix.remotemap to C:\Program Files\Propellerhead\Reason 12\Remote\DefaultMaps\Akai. Regarding Mac OS, above-mentioned directories should be located in HD/Library/Application Support/Propellerhead Software/Remote.

I have improved coding (MIDImix.lua) and mapping (MIDImix.remotemap) files for Reason. Files were downloaded from Luke's repository https://github.com/lukelengl/AkaiMIDIMixPropellerheadReasonRemote. I have implemented support for SOLO button. If you press/hold the SOLO button and press a one of MUTE buttons coressponding to one of mixer channels, the rest of channels become inactive/muted and leds for them shine in mute state - the MUTE led for unmuted/solo channel doesn't shine as it shouldn't shine. Next, the SOLO button should be pressed and MUTE button for unmuted/solo channel to unmute all muted channels. I think that this is correct mixer's behavior now. I did two mapping examples for mixers 14:2, 6:2 to demonstrate that everything works correctly.

I think that it is worth to share these these files for all people that have Reason and AKAI Midmix but they can't use the mixer with its full functionality.
